Officebot uses NLP to figure out what you want from it. It's aim is to automate many tasks through chat, to give visibility to how your team is operating. Want to pick up the next task? By doing it through Slack, your entire team can see that you're on it!

Officebot's primary focus is to create a suite of tasks it can automate away for teams, in a way that can be configurable to fit your needs.

The bot has a few prebuild tasks which can be used for todays demo, but of course it's rather restricted to ensure people don't abuse it too much. Here are some things you can ask it about, remember there isn't a command structure so just speak to it and see what happens. The current version has been focused on getting the NLP working and to a usable level.

## What can it do?

* Find out what's next on the demo trello board.
* Ask what issues are on any repository such as bluehatbrit/officebot, or microsoft/botbuilder.
* Create a new issue on github.
* Create a new team _(teams are still in development)_.

## Example usage!

* "What's next on trello?"
* "Create a new team"
* "Get issues on tryghost/ghost"
* "Hold on, what was issue 1823 on microsoft/botbuilder again?"
* "Create an issue on bluehatbrit/office called crashes on db connect"

## Important notes

* The trello integration uses [this demo board here](https://trello.com/b/viHXwBnd/vintus)
* Creating issues can only be done on `bluehatbrit/officebot` during the demo.
* Team management is still in development.
* If something goes drastically wrong just type say "halt" and it'll reset.
