## AINT355 Continuation Report

As this is an individual project have the ability to take this as far as I want in AINT355 without any real problems. My focus for AINT355 will be my own standing as a software engineer and an open source contributor / maintainer. As a result this project may well see further development but will not be the focus of my work within the module. It will of course benefit me to spend time tidying up the repository and packaging it a bit nicer for community use as well as ensuring bugs are resolved in a timely matter and that the project doesn't "die".

In conclusion, I will most likely develop the project further but it will not be my main focus of the module going forward.
